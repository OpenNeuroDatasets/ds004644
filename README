This dataset contains raw UTE, MP2RAGE, and PRESS data acquired from 3-month-old Dp1Tyb mice (a model of Down syndrome) and their wildtype littermates. Data were acquired on a 9.4T Bruker BioSpec 94/20 with a cross-coil setup of an 86-mm resonator for transmission and a receive-only 4-channel phased-array surface coil.
