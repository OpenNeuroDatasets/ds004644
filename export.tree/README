This dataset contains raw invivo UTE, MP2RAGE, and PRESS data acquired from 3-month-old Dp1Tyb mice (a model of Down syndrome) and their wildtype littermates. Subsequently, the mice were perfusion fixed and their heads stored in 8 mM Gd-DTPA foe 3 months+ before being scanned four at a time using a FLASH sequence. In vivo data were acquired on a 9.4T Bruker BioSpec 94/20 with a cross-coil setup of an 86-mm bird-cage resonator for transmission and a receive-only 4-channel phased-array surface coil. Ex vivo data were acquired on a 9.4T Bruker BioSpec 94/20 with a 39-mm bird-cage resonator.
